The ldd directory lite plugin allows you to add a powerful directory listing of local businesses or other organizations to your WordPress web site.

== Description ==

The ldd directory lite plugin is the best way to add a powerful, fully functional and free custom directory to your WordPress powered web site.

Within minutes you can install and configure ldd directory lite and start accepting submissions, or populating the content with your own listings. This is the best and easiest way to start any kind of directory you can think of, be it of local businesses (restaurants, coffee shops, craft stores, etc), or any other type of organization you would like to build around.

The Directory is extremely user friendly, ready to go pretty much out of the box. One of our primary focuses is ensuring that it integrates with almost any theme, anywhere, anytime, and we have utilized the power of Bootstrap to ensure that the Directory is 100% mobile ready and responsive. It won't break all that hard work you've put into making sure your site works on any medium.

We are also very developer friendly! Our plugin has another home on [GitHub](https://github.com/mwaterous/ldd-directory-lite), where you can get involved in making it even better.

== Installation ==

*You should always back up your data and/or test on a staging site before making major changes to the way your production web site functions.*

Installation is easiest when done through your WordPress Dashboard:
1. Select **Plugins >> Add New** from your sites WordPress dashboard.
2. Type **ldd directory lite** into the search field and press enter.
3. Click **Install Now** when you see ldd directory lite appear in the search results.
4. Select **Activate Plugin** after you see *Successfully installed the plugin ldd directory lite* appear on your screen.

If you prefer to install manually, [see the guide on Manually Installing Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

If you have any questions or are unsure about any part of the process, don't hesitate to ask for help in our [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ldd-directory-lite).

= Upgrading from LDD Business Directory =

This plugin is a rewrite of the [LDD Business Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-business-directory/). As such, you can upgrade to ldd directory lite from LDD Business Directory *without* losing any of your content.

*You do not need to deactivate or uninstall the LDD Business Directory plugin before activating ldd directory lite.*

1. Install and activate the plugin using the above instructions.
2. Once installed, if data is detected from the original plugin it will automatically notify you with a rather large message at the top of your Directory Lite dashboard screens.
3. Press the "Import Data" button, and you will be taken to the upgrade page.
4. All done!

**The plugin only imports this data, it does nothing to alter or remove it. If you decide to revert to the original plugin because of errors encountered while using this beta release, you will have all you original content waiting for you.**


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I suggest a new feature or report a bug? =

Please use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaterous/ldd-directory-lite/issues) on the plugins [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mwaterous/ldd-directory-lite).

= How can I avoid having my template customizations overwritten when the plugin is updated? =

All the template files found in `/ldd-directory-lite/templates` can be copied to a directory in your theme called *lddlite_templates*.

For example, if you need to edit `/wp-content/plugins/ldd-directory-lite/templates/category.php`, you can copy it to `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-directory/lddlite_templates/category.php`. While you can copy the entire directory verbatim, it is recommended that you only copy the files you need.

== Screenshots ==

1. Most of ldd directory lite's configuration can be ignored or set once and forgotten; focus on content, don't worry about getting caught up constantly having to change settings!
2. Whether all your content is user generated, or if it's entirely owner generated, there's an easy to use interface for adding, editing, or removing listings.
3. We have done our best to design the directory's front end interface to integrate easily and painlessly with almost any theme. While it's impossible to guarantee this happening with 100% of themes, the fully responsive minimal design will quite often seem right at home, straight out of the box.

== Credits ==

I tend to spend a lot of time coding; not only is it my day job, but it's also one of the things I like to do in my spare time. No matter how much time I spend however, I'm just one person. This plugin is where it is thanks to the hard work and open source beliefs of a great many people. While I always try to make sure they are credited in the code itself, I would like to take the time to include them here as well. In no particular order:

**Who:** [WebDevStudios](http://webdevstudios.com/)<br>
**Where:** [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress)<br>
**Why:** Used to build the administrative user interface for the directory listings custom post types.

**Who:** [yoast](https://yoast.com)<br>
**Where:** [WordPress SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/#wpseo) Usage Tracking<br>
**Why:** Code from the WordPress SEO plugin was integrated into this plugin in order to quickly add anonymous usage tracking. The information supplied by those who opt in to this program allows us a fantastic insight as to what configurations the plugin is being used on, and how to test future releases.

**Who:** [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)<br>
**Where:** Front end interface.<br>
**Why:** A trimmed down copy of bootstrap was used to rapidly define the front end interface for the plugin.

**Who:** [HappyJS](http://happyjs.com/)<br>
**Where:** Single listing view.<br>
**Why:** Happy.js is used on the listing page where strong validation is critical prior to a contact form being submitted.
