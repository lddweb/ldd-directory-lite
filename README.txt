== Description ==

The LDD Directory Lite plugin is the best way to add a powerful, fully functional and free custom directory to your WordPress powered web site.

Within minutes you can install and configure LDD Directory Lite and start accepting submissions, or populating the content with your own listings. This is the best and easiest way to start any kind of directory you can think of, be it of local businesses (restaurants, coffee shops, craft stores, etc), or any other type of organization you would like to build around.

The Directory is extremely user friendly, ready to go pretty much out of the box. One of our primary focuses is ensuring that it integrates with almost any theme, anywhere, anytime, and we have utilized the power of Bootstrap to ensure that the Directory is 100% mobile ready and responsive.

= Upgrading from LDD Business Directory =

This plugin is a rewrite of the [LDD Business Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-business-directory/). As such, you can upgrade to ldd directory lite from LDD Business Directory *without* losing any of your content.

*You do not need to deactivate or uninstall the LDD Business Directory plugin before activating ldd directory lite.*

1. Install and activate the plugin using the above instructions.
1. Once installed, if data is detected from the original plugin it will automatically notify you with a rather large message at the top of your Directory Lite dashboard screens.
1. Press the "Import Data" button, and you will be taken to the upgrade page.
1. All done!

**The plugin only imports this data, it does nothing to alter or remove it. If you decide to revert to the original plugin because of errors encountered while using this beta release, you will have all you original content waiting for you.**


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to sort categories, listings and featured listings using shortcode? =

You can sort categories using *cat_order_by*, listings using *list_order_by* and featured listings using *fl_order_by* attribute with shortcode.

e.g. [directory cat_order_by="**xxx**" cat_order="asc" fl_order_by="**xxx**" fl_order="asc" list_order_by="**xxx**" list_order="asc"]

**cat_order_by="xxx" :**
* id
* slug
* title
* count

**fl_order_by="**xxx**"**
* business_name
* zip
* area
* category
* random

**list_order_by="**xxx**"**
* business_name
* zip
* area
* category
* random

= How to show listings from specific category(s) using shortcode? =

You can display category specify listings using the following shortcode.

[directory_category slug="my-category,my-other-category" view="compact" list_order_by="title" list_order="ASC" limit="8"]

**view="xxx" :**
* grid
* compact

**list_order_by="**xxx**"**
* business_name
* zip
* area
* category
* random

**list_order="**xxx**"**
* ASC
* DESC

= How can I avoid having my template customizations overwritten when the plugin is updated? =

All the template files found in `/ldd-directory-lite/templates` can be copied to a directory in your theme called *lddlite_templates*.

For example, if you need to edit `/wp-content/plugins/ldd-directory-lite/templates/category.php`, you can copy it to `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-directory/lddlite_templates/category.php`. While you can copy the entire directory verbatim, it is recommended that you only copy the files you need.

== Screenshots ==

1. Most of ldd directory lite's configuration can be ignored or set once and forgotten; focus on content, don't worry about getting caught up constantly having to change settings!
2. Whether all your content is user generated, or if it's entirely owner generated, there's an easy to use interface for adding, editing, or removing listings.
3. We have done our best to design the directory's front end interface to integrate easily and painlessly with almost any theme. While it's impossible to guarantee this happening with 100% of themes, the fully responsive minimal design will quite often seem right at home, straight out of the box.
