# LDD Directory Lite

> This is a fork of the [LDD Business Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-business-directory/) plugin. Going forward the original plugin is considered unsupported and all active development will occur under the new name, ldd directory lite.

* **Working Version**: 0.8-beta
* **Latest Stable**: 
* **Contributors**: [@mwaterous](https://github.com/mwaterous)

The ldd directory lite plugin is a great way to add a powerful, feature rich and completely free custom directory to your WordPress web site.

Installation and configuration takes mere moments, and you can quickly start building a content rich directory of local businesses, restaurants, municipal services, non-profit organizations, or almost any other type of listing you can think of. Set your location, and build a completely local list of organizations or events, or leave it open and have an international directory.

### Here are just a few of the many features:

* Easy to install, easy to configure
* Add the `[directory]` and `[directory_submit]` shortcode to any page (automatically installed for you, but feel free to change them)
* Customize the look and feel as much, or as little as you want
* Features can easily be enabled or disabled on the dashboard
* Users can easily maintain their listings through a front end control panel
* Fully customizable email notifications, for the admin and the user
* Strong focus on internationalization, we want this to work for everyone, everywhere
* Clean, fully responsive interface
* Social media integration, build traffic for your users
* Google Maps integration
* Lightweight but still powerful

### Coming soon:

* **Our web site! This will be the home of extended documentation, community forums, premium support and much more!**
* Premium modules, extend the capabilities of the Directory with features like import/export
* Shortcodes to display single categories or listings where ever you want



## Installation

###### *You should always back up your data and/or test on a staging site before making major changes to the way your production web site functions.*

Installation is easiest when done through your WordPress Dashboard:
Select the **Add New** option under your **Plugins** menu, type in *ldd directory lite* and install directly from the repository.

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps;

1. Download the latest stable version from [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-directory-lite/)
2. Upload the archived plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin from the **Plugins** screen on your dashboard
4. Necessary pages will automatically be installed for you containing the appropriate short codes. Feel free to further customize these!

If you have any questions or are unsure about any part of the process, don't hesitate to ask for help in the [WordPress.org Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ldd-directory-lite)

## Upgrading from LDD Business Directory

###### *You do not need to deactivate or uninstall the LDD Business Directory plugin before activating ldd directory lite.*

This plugin is a rewrite of the [LDD Business Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-business-directory/). As such, you can upgrade to ldd directory lite from LDD Business Directory *without* losing any of your content.

1. Install and activate the plugin using the instructions [here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ldd-directory-lite/installation/).
2. The plugin will collect all your existing content and import it automatically.

As of now the plugin *does not* remove the data from the original Directory plugin. It also does not store any of its own data in the same locations, so the two datasets are completely separate.

While this does leave some clutter behind, it also ensures a painless upgrade path. Until the plugin has successfully been upgraded on a few hundred more sites, we chose not to remove your old data in case you either wanted to roll back to using the original plugin, or on the chance that something went awry with the beta.

A future version of ldd directory lite will scan for this leftover data and ask if you want to remove it.

## Credits

I tend to spend a lot of time coding; not only is it my day job, but it's also one of the things I like to do in my spare time. No matter how much time I spend however, I'm just one person. This plugin is where it is thanks to the hard work and open source beliefs of more people than just myself. While I always try to make sure they are credited in the code itself, I would like to take the time to include them here as well. In no particular order:

**Who:** [WebDevStudios](http://webdevstudios.com/)<br>
**Where:** [Custom Metaboxes and Fields for WordPress](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress)<br>
**Why:** Used to build the administrative user interface for the directory listings custom post types.

**Who:** [yoast](https://yoast.com)<br>
**Where:** [WordPress SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/#wpseo) Usage Tracking<br>
**Why:** Code from the WordPress SEO plugin was integrated into this plugin in order to quickly add anonymous usage tracking. The information supplied by those who opt in to this program allows us a fantastic insight as to what configurations the plugin is being used on, and how to test future releases.

**Who:** [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)<br>
**Where:** Front end interface.<br>
**Why:** A trimmed down copy of bootstrap was used to rapidly define the front end interface for the plugin.

**Who:** [HappyJS](http://happyjs.com/)<br>
**Where:** Single listing view.<br>
**Why:** Happy.js is used on the listing page where strong validation is critical prior to a contact form being submitted.

If I forgot anyone, it was not intentional and will be added to future updates of this file.
